# ProximalGradientMethod
This repository is meant to promote reproduction of the results presented in the work "Exact worst-case convergence rates of the proximal gradient method for composite convex minimization" authored by A. Taylor, J. Hendrickx and F. Glineur.

The repository contains:

(1) The symbolic validations for the main proofs contained in the work.

(2) Numerical validations (using the Performance Estimation Toolbox PESTO) of the results of the last section (mixed performance measures).
